 * Append lists using recursion
 * 
 * Similar to F#, prolog lists can be cut to Head (first element) and Tail (remaining list)
 * Prolog works backwards...similar to F# recursion in some ways. You will see it in the following example.
 * 
 * Complete the Koans. Get the query: ?-my_append([1,2,5],[3,4],Result). work.
 * Set a breakpoint to the second my_append func, hit run, watch the code go step by step.
